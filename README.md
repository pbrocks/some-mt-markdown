# React Markdown Doc

Live Demo : https://lucid-newton-42e898.netlify.com/

## Laconic
React Markdown Doc was developed to provide a SSG easy to maintain and as modular as possible, built on top of React 16 and Webpack4, it should also be compatible with mainstream static hosting platforms (Apache, now, netlify, surge etc...).

> DEC2019: I did find docusaurus which is offering similar features, so no enhancement is planned for this project

## Usage

### Exporting markdown files
Assuming that a file `foo.md` has been added in the `docs`  folder, to export it just add a line like the below in `docs/index.js` :

``` JavaScript
export { default as foo } from './foo.md'
```
Repeat the process for any markdown file that you'd like to expose as Views

### Route Configuration

Assuming that a valid markdown `foo` has been exported from `docs`

We'll import it this way :
``` JavaScript
import { foo } from '~/docs'
```
and then, we'll create a new route to display this document as a new view :

``` JavaScript
const routes = [
  { 'path': '/foo', component: composeMD(foo) },
]
```
composeMD is a High Order Component function, that'll generate a new component using markdown data.

A new route will be created `/foo` reachable at
`$(HOST)/foo`

### UI Configuration
#### Navbar
``` JavaScript
// navLeft is the left area of the navbar
// you can configure Application name by
// replacing the label value or you can
// put the URI of an img, to display an image
// instead of a clickable label
const navLeft = {
  path: '/',
  label: 'Application',
  imgSrc: ''
}

// navRight is the right area of the navbar
// These are clickable links characterized by
// their path : target path
// label: label displayed
// For now, there's just one level, no dropdown
const navRight = [
  { path: '/', label: 'Getting Started' },
  { path: '/example', label: 'Example' },
  { path: '/table', label: 'Table' }
]
```
#### Sidebar
``` JavaScript
// sidebar is the left area of the view
// These are clickable links with icon (see ant design: https://ant.design/components/icon/)
const sidebar = [
  { path: '/', label: 'A', icon: 'setting' },
  { path: '/foo', label: 'B', icon: 'team' }
]
```

## Markdown Rendering

## Starting the app

```
yarn && yarn start
```

Then open a browser and type :
```
http://localhost:8080
```
That's it.

### Roadmap

- [x] React-router v4 integration
- [x] webpack 4 integration
- [x] Live demo
- [ ] Code block render from Markdown
- [ ] Responsive Layout

## Netlify deployment

Configure a new project,
Set `yarn prod` as the production command.

## Apache deployment
